# Nide Is not an IDE  
That is the complete name for Nide
## What is Nide?  
Nide is a relatibly lighweight text editor that combines nano with vscode.  
It still doesn't have much nano keybinds but as a terminal and a file explorer where you can choose a folder and list all the files to read from them.  
Nide is made with Go and fyne, and because of them some may call it BLAZINGLY FAST (it's not that fast).
